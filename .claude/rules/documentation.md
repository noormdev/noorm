# Documentation Rules


## Three-Pillar Structure

Build each section with Memory, Reasoning, and Example woven together. The pillars are invisible scaffolding.

| Pillar | Purpose | Expression |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Memory | The what | Concepts, definitions, data structures |
| Reasoning | The why | Motivation, trade-offs, design decisions |
| Example | The how | Code samples, workflows, practical demonstrations |


## Style

Start with the problem the reader wants to solve. Explain through analogy before technical detail.

Use short sentences mixed with longer explanations. Show "why" before "how". Code follows explanation.

Create visual hierarchy through headers, code blocks, and tables.


## Tone

Conversational but precise. Guide the reader from familiar concepts to new ones.
