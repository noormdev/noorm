CHANGE FF - Fast-forward: apply all pending changesets

USAGE
    noorm change ff [options]
    noorm -H change ff

OPTIONS
    -c, --config NAME   Use specific configuration
    -f, --force         Skip checksum validation
    --dry-run           Preview without executing

DESCRIPTION
    Applies all pending changesets in order. This is the primary command
    for running migrations in CI/CD pipelines.

    Changesets are applied in alphabetical order by name. Each changeset
    is executed within a transaction when supported by the database.

    If a changeset fails, execution stops and subsequent changesets are
    not applied. The failed changeset is marked as 'failed' in the history.

EXAMPLES
    noorm -H change ff               Apply all pending (uses active config)
    noorm -H -c prod change ff       Apply all pending on production
    noorm -H --dry-run change ff     Preview what would be applied
    noorm -H --force change ff       Skip checksum validation

EXIT CODES
    0   All changesets applied successfully
    1   One or more changesets failed
