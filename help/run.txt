RUN - Execute SQL files

USAGE
    noorm run [subcommand] [options]

SUBCOMMANDS
    build           Execute all SQL files in schema directory
    file PATH       Execute a single SQL file
    dir PATH        Execute all SQL files in a directory

DESCRIPTION
    Run SQL files directly against the database. Unlike changesets,
    these are not tracked for migration history.

    Build mode executes files in the schema/ directory in order,
    tracking checksums to skip unchanged files on subsequent runs.

OPTIONS
    -f, --force     Force execution (skip checksum validation)
    --dry-run       Preview without executing

EXAMPLES
    noorm -H run build               Build from schema/
    noorm -H run file seed.sql       Execute single file
    noorm -H run dir migrations/     Execute all SQL in directory
    noorm -H --force run build       Rebuild all (ignore checksums)
