    noorm lock [subcommand] [options]

SUBCOMMANDS
    status      Check current lock status
    acquire     Acquire the database lock
    release     Release the current lock
    force       Force release (override ownership)

DESCRIPTION
    Distributed locking prevents concurrent migrations in multi-instance
    deployments. Use locks to coordinate CI/CD pipelines.

    Locks are stored in the database and include:
    - Lock holder identity
    - Acquisition timestamp
    - Expiration time

EXAMPLES
    noorm -H lock status             Check if locked
    noorm -H lock acquire            Acquire lock
    noorm -H lock release            Release lock

    # CI/CD with lock protection:
    noorm -H lock acquire
    trap "noorm -H lock release" EXIT
    noorm -H change ff
